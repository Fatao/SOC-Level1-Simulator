# 🛡️ SOC Level 1 Simulator – TryHackMe Project

## 💼 Real-World SOC Analyst Simulation

This project documents my hands-on experience with the [TryHackMe SOC Level 1 Simulator](https://tryhackme.com/), a simulated Security Operations Center (SOC) training environment. The purpose is to **replicate real-world blue team operations**, improve threat detection and investigation skills, and showcase the complete workflow of a SOC Analyst — from alert triage to final incident reporting.

---

## 🎯 Project Goal

> **"Build real-world expertise in a simulated SOC environment. Tackle authentic challenges, sharpen investigative skills, and improve performance through actionable feedback tailored to enhance readiness."**

---

## 🔧 What This Includes

- 📡 **Simulated alert investigations** across multiple threat scenarios
- 🧠 **Threat actor TTP identification** and MITRE ATT&CK mapping
- 📑 **Incident reports with IOCs and recommendations**
- ⚙️ **Real-world tool usage**: Splunk, Wireshark, Sigma, Sysmon, PCAP analysis
- 🔬 **Performance measurement** using SOC KPIs (MTTR, Dwell Time, FP rate)

---

## 🧪 Key Features of the Simulator

### ✅ 1. Hands-On Threat Actor TTPs
Experience attacker behavior through a safe and isolated lab, simulating real adversaries and techniques.

### ⚡ 2. Realtime Attack Simulation
Alerts are triggered in real-time as threat actor actions unfold, mimicking dynamic attack timelines.

### 🛑 3. Realistic Alert Queues
Triage alerts based on severity, category, and recency — just like in an actual SOC environment.

### 🔍 4. Forensics on Malicious Artifacts
Use real-world tools to investigate suspicious links, files, and IPs and map them to the cyber kill chain.

### 📊 5. Live Splunk Event Log Analysis
Search through a congested SIEM environment to distinguish noise from real threats using Splunk.

### 🧾 6. Final Report Creation
Close out alerts with clear incident reports that include eradication, containment, and recovery recommendations.

### 🤖 7. AI-Powered Feedback
Receive instant qualitative and quantitative analysis on your written reports and IOCs.

### 📈 8. Track KPIs
Measure Mean Time to Respond (MTTR), Dwell Time, False Positive Rate, and more to track performance.

### 📆 9. Visualize Progress Over Time
Gain insights into how training translates into improved security posture.

### 🎯 10. Identify Skill Gaps
Pinpoint which types of attacks or alert categories need improvement based on KPIs and response effectiveness.
